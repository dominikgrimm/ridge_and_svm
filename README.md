# Ridge Regression vs Support Vector Machine

This repo contains examples of Ridge Regression and SVM. The first two Notebooks (Ridge Rigression and SVM) contain examples of how to use Ridge Regression and SVM on simple toy data to get a better intuition how these algorithms work. The third Notebook (Anwendungsbeispiel) contains a toy example of how to apply Ridge Regression, SVM and SVM with a RBF kernel.  
Note: All Notebooks are in German only.
